PhoneGap Spikes
===============

This project only aims at spiking a few PhoneGap features in order to evaluate its usage versus developping native apps for Android and iOS.

Geo location

This first spike retrieves geo location coordinates via the phone GPS, get the corresponding address from Google Map Geocoder, and display the user location on Google Maps.
